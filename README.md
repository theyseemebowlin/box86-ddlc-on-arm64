# DDLC and Steam on arm64 computers, with the power of box86 and wine
I'm fairly new to github and all of this stuff (this is my first repository) so please bear with me.
Download the DDLC file from https://ddlc.moe before running runddlc.sh. Do `cd steam-and-ddlc-on-arm64` then `chmod 744 runddlc.sh` and `chmod 744 runsteam.sh` before running the files.
Run DDLC.sh before runsteam.sh
Huge thanks to ptitSeb, Kron4ek, NicoD-SBC, and the creators of wine, for making all of this work, this wouldn't exist without them.
If it works, hope you enjoy!
